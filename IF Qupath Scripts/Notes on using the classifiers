To use the classifiers I have already made in a new project. In the main project directory (where the .qproj file is
 located). Have a folder called 'classifiers'. In the folder put the below 'classes' .json file. Also make a folder called 'object
 classifiers' and put the classifiers .json files in there.
 The channel names and detection measurements used in the .json file classifiers must be used, so make sure the
 current project names and measurements applied match.
